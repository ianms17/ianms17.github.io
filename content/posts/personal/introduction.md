## Introduction
Hello, there! My name is Ian Stephenson. 

I'm writing this about a week removed from the birth of my first kid. For a long time, I've thought about starting blog because I don't get to do enough writing. You know what they say, right? There's no time like the present.

I want this post to operate as a "Where Am I Now?" that I can go back to. Who am I? What do I like? What do I want out of life? What's better than a post that lives forever on the internet to give me a chance at some self-reflection ten years from now.

### My Interests
I have a lot interests, so this may be quite a long list, but it won't all go here. Here's the highlights.

I'm a huge Chicago Bears fan. I've been a fan of the Bears since February 4th, 2007. I was living in the Chicago area, and the Bears were playing the Colts in Super Bowl XLI. This is the first football game I remember watching, and it was all because of the opening play. Devin Hester, Chicago Bears legend and whose jersey is hanging in my office, housed the opening kickoff for a touchdown. It was electric, and I've been a fan ever since.

I'm also an avid gamer, though not quite in the same way that I used to be. I really love role playing games; Skyrim, Cyberpunk 2077, Fallout. I love detailed worlds that you can never fully uncover. Worlds that feel real, that feel like they exist around you, that you can escape into. I'm also a huge fan of sports games, in particular I've been absolutely loving MLB the Show and EA Sport's College Football. Lastly, anything made by Rockstar. GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2 are phenomenal. RDR2 in particular is a masterpiece; the perfect combination of a beautiful, open world, deep and intentional character development for both the player and non-player characters, and a strong social commentary on being a part of a world that has moved on from you.

I love golf, too. I've been playing since high school, and just a couple weeks ago I watched my favorite golfer, Rory McIlroy, win the Masters, and now I'm dreaming of one day going to Augusta National.

Last, but not least, I spend way too much time on fantasy football. As this blog will find out this Summer, there are few things that bring me as much satisfaction as coming up with hot takes that pan out, or just having arguments with my friends about some of my most braindead convictions.

### My Aspirations
There are a lot of things that I want to do with my life, some of which I probably won't end up doing. Just to keep this centered, I want this to career aspirations.

As of April 2025, I'm a Cloud Engineer at Chewy. In this role, I've built quite a bit of automation, written a lifetime worth of Terraform, and got my hands dirty with AWS. And, at least for now, I'm enjoying it.

But, I do want to do more. I've thought a lot recently about pursuing an MBA and moving into the business side of things. I've often thought that I have a good sight for the bigger picture. I also take pride in my ability to communicate technical details to less technical stakeholders, especially in my writing. If I could get a crash course in how to impact the business, I think I could be dangerous.

With that, I want the chance to moved more into a decision maker role. I want to be able to influence the direction of a software engineering team, and eventually give technical direction to the whole organization or company (but everthing in due time).

I would also love to start a business one day. I don't have an idea right now, but if and when I do, I'm going for it. When I check back on this later in life, this is the one that I most want to come true.
