## PyHCL Fancy
### Description
PyHCL Fancy is Python library that wraps [python-hcl2](https://pypi.org/project/python-hcl2/) to transform parsed HCL into a tree-like structure to provide a more developer friendly API for interacting with Terraform. The goal of PyHCL Fancy is to be a base for more complex automation that requires a more intuitive, easier to understand protcol for interacting with and interpreting Terraform.
